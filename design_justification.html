       <p class="text prototype">In the last class we had we made a paper prototype for our website. The end result can be found in the images on the left. First the necessary components for the website were put on sticky notes and distributed over the pages. With this we created the flow diagram, that showed us how customers would move through the website. We eventually came up with this design: A welcome page with pictures, a weekly updates section, an introduction to the brand, and testimonials from customers.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
	   <p class="text prototype">The about page was divided in the Mission and Vision and short paragraphs introducing the team. The webshop is where users can buy tickets to events that are being organized. The events are shown with pictures and a description what the event is about. The vacancy page was something Jessie later added because it is part of our lean canvas idea. On this page people can look for job openings posted by companies, a user can filter what branch they would like to work in.</p> 
    </div>
	<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-4">
	   <p class="text prototype">After doing a test run with the paper prototype we concluded that we would need pop ups for the buying of the tickets, letting buyers know their purchase was successful. Once we started working on the actual website, a lot from our initial prototype changed, or we added extra assets. For example the sign up button, the vacancy page, which was added after working on the lean canvas. This ofcourse also changed the user flow of the website, which we tested once the website was done.</p>

      <p class="text textabout">With the paper prototype in mind we started building the website. Jessie and Oscar started setting up the base of the website, the structural design. Adinda and Mees later added design elements, photos and text. For the website we used the same attributes used in the brand roadmap. The fonts are clear fonts that are easily readable. These colours were chosen to create contrast but also a have a spring feeling. The green and yellow create contrast when used on the grey background. The background colour was chosen to be more calming and relaxed for the eye. The colours are used throughout the website to create order and hierarchy. Green is used for big headers and yellow for sub headers. We also created hierarchy with font-size and font-weight.</p>

      <p class="text textabout">Our brand was designed to help people in the creative industry. This website was designed to do just that. You can make an account by clicking the button in the upper right cornor in the nav-bar, and become part of the creative industry community. You can buy tickets to networking events in the media industry, where you can meet employers and employees. As a member of the website you can also look for job openings on the vacancy page. These are all jobs within the creative industry. When researching our platform by making a lean canvas, a preference for job searching platform became clear. People wanted to use the platform for finding jobs, so that is the first thing next to home on the navigation bar. We chose to put that first instead of the web-shop since that will be visited less frequently.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-12">
      <p class="text textabout">We used a floating navigation bar, so no matter how far you scroll down on a page, you can always easily go to another page. We created a filter element on the vacancy page, so the user can filter the jobs on his er her own preferences. When on a small screen, the filter sidebar will change from the side to the top of the page, so enough space is left for the other content. We used different forms for signing up to the website, for applying for a job and for purchasing a ticket.</p>

        <p class="expert1">Tester One</p>
        <p> Noa was given different assignments during her using testing. She mostly made use of the navigation bar to get to the specific page, but she also the weekly update column to buy a ticket for an event. Some mistakes occured when filling in the 'Sign up' form and then submitting it. It was not directed to the website and resulted in an error. Noa noticed some inconsistencies in margins and suggested to change that. We have changed both problems after the user testing.</p>

        <p> Iris explored our website and then carried out the given assignments. The website is very easy and convenient. Incredibly user-friendly and nice look. Only with the sing up form it was not possible to upload a CV as a PDF. This is now fixed!</p>

        <p class="expert1">Tester Three</p>
        <p> When Maddi browsed the website, she immediatly commented on how well the website looked, I quote: "this looks like the real deal". When running through the scenarios there were no problems, all problems found in earlier tests had already been solved. The navigation was clear to her and she could find everything quickly. Her only suggestion would be to add a searchbar in the navigationbar. A great recommendation for improvement. </p>

        <p class="expert1">Tester Four</p>
        <p>We gave Frank different assignments during his testing. He used the navigation bar to succesfully get to all pages. A problem he ran into when told to buy a ticket for an event, when going to the webshop page he quickly scrolled down without reading the titles of each events which were posted above the image confusing him wondering which one he had to buy. Once he figured it out he suggested it should be below the image to make it more clear which we now have changed.</p>
